Network interface screen for [lcdproc](http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/)
======================================================================

This is a quick python hack to display the network interfaces using
[lcdproc](http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/).

Install
-------

Start it up as root, e.g. from `/etc/rc.local`. It will daemonize itself and log to `syslog`.

Patches are welcome, especially to fix the sometimes missed button
events. Although once these servers are gone from me, I'll have no
means to test the patches, so please pay extra attention when testing!

The easiest way:

1. Fork it on github.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my_changes`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added foobar"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_changes`)
5. Open a [Pull Request](http://github.com/github/markup/pulls)
6. Wait
7. After a while bug maintainer if nothing happens
